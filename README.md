This is two graphs made in javascript utlizing Chart.js. I made this for an Internship at Ultrajaya. 
The first graph in the src file called Final.html shows for every distributer the amount that they buy compared to how much they sell.
The second graph titled Final2.html shows the target sales vs the acutal sales and predicted sales to see if the company is on track.
